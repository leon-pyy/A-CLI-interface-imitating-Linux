# A-CLI-interface-imitating-Linux
A concise Linux like command-line interface. The demo was demonstrated using STM32F411CEU6. You can also deploy it on any RTOS system and bare metal program for easy development and debugging.
This program can implement a command-line interface similar to Linux, which can complete TAB commands, uncheck cells, view history commands with arrow keys, and move the cursor. In short, it has basic functions and can meet basic usage needs. Of course, certain modifications need to be made during porting, such as serial port drivers and reception processes, depending on the situation. This code is derived from an embedded project I previously participated in at school before., as the board of the project is not equipped with an operating system similar to Linux. In some cases, debugging using JTAG or ST-Link can be very cumbersome, especially when your embedded board needs to fine tune parameters outdoors and view real-time running status or print logs. Therefore, this set of code was written for serial port debugging.
These codes were written in 2023. It's only recently that I have had the time to sort them out...
